# logic-collection
This is my space to recapping every logic problem that i've done so far.

content:
- swap variabel (swap-var)
- palindrome checker (palindrome-check)
- string masking (masking-string)
- delete an ordered copy of char (unique-in-order)
- detect the not-included character (detect-the-exclude)
- count how many smiling faces from an array (smiling-face-count)

hopefully i have mood to always update this repository :)
